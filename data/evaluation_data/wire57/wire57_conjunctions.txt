Finnish police reprimanded a man for traveling in a car boot to hide his meeting with Prime Minister Juha Sipila during a government crisis last summer , saying this was breach of the traffic code .


A police statement did not name the man in the boot , but in effect indicated the traveler was State Secretary Samuli Virtanen , who is also the deputy to Foreign Minister Timo Soini .

The meeting took place in June , a day after Virtanen 's co-ruling Finns party had elected anti-immigration hardliners as its new leaders .


The government was close to collapse until a group of politicians , including Virtanen and Soini , in the following week walked out of the Finns party and announced they would form a new group .

In statistics , an expectation – maximization ( EM ) algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum likelihood or maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimates of parameters in statistical models , where the model depends on unobserved latent variables .

In statistics , an expectation – maximization ( EM ) algorithm is an iterative method to find maximum a posteriori ( MAP ) estimates of parameters in statistical models , where the model depends on unobserved latent variables .

The EM iteration alternates between performing an expectation ( E ) step , which creates a function for the expectation of the log -likelihood evaluated using the current estimate for the parameters , and a maximization ( M ) step , which computes parameters maximizing the expected log - likelihood found on the E step .


These parameter - estimates are then used to determine the distribution of the latent variables in the next E step .


The EM algorithm was explained and given its name in a classic 1977 paper by Arthur Dempster , Nan Laird , and Donald Rubin .

They pointed out that the method had been " proposed many times in special circumstances " by earlier authors .


A very detailed treatment of the EM method for exponential families was published by Rolf Sundberg in his thesis and several papers following his collaboration with Per Martin - Löf and Anders Martin - Löf .

Regardless of earlier inventions , the innovative Dempster – Laird – Rubin paper in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society received an enthusiastic discussion at the Royal Statistical Society meeting with Sundberg calling the paper " brilliant " .


The Dempster – Laird –Rubin paper established the EM method as an important tool of statistical analysis .


After a year of relatively healthy global economic growth , economists are predicting pretty much the same for 2018 -- a neither too - hot nor too - cold Goldilocks scenario , but with little sight of the three bears .


The idea is that all is pretty much on track for growth that will be stronger than in 2017 .


Part of this may come from the fact that forecasters generally got it wrong last year , underclubbing this year 's economic performance , particularly for the euro zone and Japan .

The International Monetary Fund , for example , saw 2017 global growth at 3.4 percent with advanced economies advancing 1.8 percent .

'' Faster growth is reaching roughly two - thirds of the world 's population , '' the IMF said in a December blog post .


This performance has made some economists optimistic .


Nomura is among the more bullish : '' Global growth has far more self - reinforcing characteristics at present than at any time over the last 20 - 30 years . ''
